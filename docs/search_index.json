Sylvain "],["introduction.html", "Introduction 0.1 ToDo", " Introduction Tysklind et al (in prep) used 20 Symphonia juveniles from the transplantation garden experiment for transcriptomic analysis. The analysis followed the scheme suggested by Lopez-Maestre et al. (2016) (Fig. 0.1). First, reads were assembled with Trinity into transcripts. In parrallel, SNPs were detected with Kissplice. Then SNPs have been mapped on the transcritpome with BLAT. In parrallel SNPs have been tested to be morphotype-specific at the level (\\(P&lt;0.001\\)) with KissDE and transcriptome Open Reading Frames (ORF) have been identified with Transdecoder. Finally, SNPs functional impact have been evaluated through k2rt. Figure 0.1: Analysis scheme from Lopez-Maestre et al.
